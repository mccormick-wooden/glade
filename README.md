## Beacons

Beacons are special seeds sent as forward recon/attack positions by the invading enemy. The player must find and destroy beacons to progress towards the boss fight.

### How to Use

- Beacons are manually added/placed to the scene using the Beacon prefab
- The number of active beacons is displayed in the bottom-left of the HUD
- Hitting a beacon with the "Sword" disables a beacon

### Known-Issues

- Hitting the beacon with the sword does not always disable even if it 'looks' like it should. This is an issue with the sword and/or the fact that the beacon is making sure the sword is swinging.
